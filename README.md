# Hyphen Tamer

Many style guides specify strict rules around what can and cannot be hyphenated. Proper nouns in particular are often ruled out, so given a container element, this jQuery plugin prevents capitalized words from being hyphenated by the CSS `hyphens` property.

## Usage

**Coming soon.** This is a work in progress.

## Limitations

* Words that appear at the beginning of a sentence, naturally capitalized despite not always being proper nouns, will not be allowed to hyphenate when this plugin is used.
